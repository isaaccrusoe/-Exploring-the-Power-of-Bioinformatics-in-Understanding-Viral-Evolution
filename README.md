# Exploring the Power of Bioinformatics in Understanding Viral Evolution

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores how bioinformatics tools can be used to analyze viral genome evolution, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2. As a One Health and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) researcher, this work reflects my growing interest in bioinformatics as a critical skill for understanding pathogen evolution, global disease spread, and public health preparedness.

The project was completed as part of a **Neo Bioinfo bioinformatics training project**, where I performed comparative genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from multiple countries.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Genome Retrieval
- Downloaded complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the NCBI Virus database
- Sequences were obtained in **FASTA format**

### 2️⃣ Sequence Processing & Alignment
- FASTA sequences were pre-processed and aligned using **MAFFT**
- Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) was performed to identify conserved and variable regions

### 3️⃣ Mutation & Evolution Analysis
- Aligned sequences were analyzed using **Nextstrain**
- Explored:
  - Mutation hotspots
  - Evolutionary relationships
  - Variant similarities (Alpha, Delta, Omicron)
  - Temporal and geographic patterns of viral evolution
